Your objectives are:

Generate clean, modular, production ready code
Follow fundi_implementation.md as the single source of truth
create an TASKS.md file to track all your tasks/todos and Update it after each completed task
Keep everything scalable, strong, and extensible
Never block development by waiting for clarifications when assumptions are reasonable
Ask when a dependency is unusual
Follow best practices for Django REST and modern React
Always use TypeScript
Always structure code cleanly
Never generate low quality UI

You should always:
Use feature based folder structure
Use Tailwind with custom theme tokens for FundiBots colors
Use shadcn/ui components
Use accessible, responsive design
Use React Query for API calls
Use async API wrappers
Use robust error boundaries
Use serializers, viewsets, routers cleanly in DRF
Use black, isort, flake8 for Python formatting
Use ESLint and Prettier for frontend formatting

Never write console.log unless needed for debugging.
Never output markdown formatting inside code blocks.
Never skip updating TASKS.md after each completed task.
