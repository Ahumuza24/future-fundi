Future Fundi ­ Curriculum Concept Note
Confidential / 23 / Oct / 2025
Concept Note -- Internal (Curriculum Development Team)
Summary
From "Robotics and code-only" to a Future Fundi STEM system that spans the full scope of science, technology, engineering and math, connects student lessons  student artifacts  skills  credentials  work, and is deliverable anywhere (schools, community centres, franchise pods) with low overhead, high visibility and exceptional outcomes.
1) Why we're shifting (problem & opportunity)
What's not working (old model):
 Robotics = strong hook, but too narrow; parents ask "what next?" and we've been vague/open-ended about the child's future potential.
 Limited mapping from lesson modules to career pathways and industry exposure.  Teacher development depends on in-house staff; scale stalls when we need breadth.
 Visibility relies on "cool demos" instead of verified community impact.
 Parents are overwhelmed by the rapid evolution of technology.
 Increase in competitors doing the basics from Fundi Bots in 2016.  Low public visibility for impact ­ overshadowed by flashier, but shallow competitors.
What we're building instead:
 A Future Fundi system that tracks a learner (6­21) across interests, skills, artifacts, outcomes and career. We are invested in the child's future.
 A framework for parents to understand the 4IR future and align themselves and their children for this future.
 Breadth and depth across Sciences (e.g Earth/Env/Health), Technology/AI, Engineering/Manufacturing, Mathematics/Data.
 Clear pathways (Technician · Practitioner · Researcher · Entrepreneur) with stackable, verifiable micro-credentials.
 Teacher/Instructor development pipeline (Fundi staff · affiliates · government clusters) with pods, tool libraries, and open badges.
 Community impact as the core proof: results and verified proof of knowledge and skills, not just optics.
 Strong industry connections for exposure, skills, mentorship and careers.  Integration of AI tools to provide exposure to generative AI tools while facilitating
independent, accelerated learning.

2) Vision & outcomes (2026­2030)
Vision: Every Future Fundi learner graduates each year with (a) a portfolio of verified artefacts, (b) at least one market-relevant credential, and (c) a clear next step (e.g shadow day, internship, job trial, franchise pod leadership, or scholarship), and (d) continued learning pathways (depending on age, stage) Outcomes we'll measure (termly, roll-up annually):
 Learning: + attendance, + formative assessments in science/math.  Skills: # artifacts per learner; # micro-credentials earned; safety score.  Careers: # shadow days/internships/placements; employer engagement hours.  Community impact: asset uptime, cost savings, households served.  Equity: girls' participation, disability access, low-bandwidth reach.  Scale efficiency: student: teacher ratios, technology usage, pod utilization, kit unit costs,
tutor/helpdesk availability (SLA)
Q: Terminology
Artifacts
These are concrete, verifiable work products or portfolio pieces a learner creates that show what they can do--not just what they know. They're portable evidence that ties skills  process  result  impact. Examples (by type)
 Hardware/prototype: sensor circuit, solar charger, hand-washing station  Software/data: code repo, dashboard, trained model, analysis notebook  Geo/field: map, survey, water-quality log, maintenance checklist  Process/SOP: safety procedure, repair guide, bill of materials  Communication: 1-page brief, poster, 60-sec demo video, reflection  Impact proof: before/after photos, uptime/savings metric, resident sign-off Note: Quizzes and evaluations feed into learning, but the artefact is the thing someone can inspect, run, or reuse to confirm solid learning outcomes. Minimum "artefact pack" Title · date · domain tags · skills demonstrated · link(s) (repo/docs/video) · test results/metrics · reflection (5 lines) · safety checklist · verification (teacher/mentor or community).
Pods
A Pod is a small, repeatable unit of delivery with 10­30 learners or 10­20 teachers meeting on a fixed cadence (usually weekly, perhaps 90 minutes) to run a hands-on module with pre-bagged kits, a simple run-of-show, and light data capture. Pods are the building blocks that let us scale fast without heavy headcount.

3) Curriculum architecture (the Future Fundi Growth Tree)
The Future Fundi Growth Tree is a living learner-analogous model (ages 6­21) that turns curiosity into projects, projects into skills, and skills into pathways while staying safe, inclusive, and exam-aligned.
